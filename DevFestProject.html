<h2 style="color:white;">With Care, Your Neighbor Project Mission</h2>
<p>Homelessness adds an indescribable amount of stress onto the human psyche. Often, some of the needs people struggle to fulfill are access to food, a safe space to spend the night, access to medical attention, among other things.
The fear of lack of safety, food, and New York City's harsh weather conditions are constant stressors which can take a toll on the human psyche. The effect of homelessness on one's mental health is a problem, especially as many people "fall off the grid" and don't receive
the mental health treatment they need. Let's aim to close this gap, and help each other as New Yorkers.
This project aims to:<br><strong> 1. Bring access to resources to one place
<br>2. Connect people in need with professionals or trained volunteers in their community who can help
<br>3. Giving alternative support and resources which are accessible to all New Yorkers
<br>4. Partner with LinkNYC to make these resources readily available across the City </strong></p>
